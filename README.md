# San's DOTFILES

A collection dotfiles for various customizations.

Some of these are my personal preferences and many of
these are sourced from many opensource dotfiles.

Your Mileage May Vary!

## Installation

Make sure you backed up your existing dotfiles.

```shell
cd # Takes you to your home dir
git clone https://github.com/sanspace/dotfiles.git # Clone my dotfiles
~/dotfiles/bin/install  # Install Dotfiles
```
Configure your name and email in `~/dotfiles/git/gitconfig`

```
[user]
        name = <name>
        email = <email>
```

That's it. You're good to go!
